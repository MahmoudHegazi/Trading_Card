# Trading_Card
This was an udacity project, I used HTML5, CSS3, Google font api and font effect, and it was my first project in the program

You only need to clone the repo (download) or just copy the index.html content into your editor and check the code,
I have used a built-in stylesheet to make the verification process easy and fast.
